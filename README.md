I'm a Java developer based in the United Kingdom with a passion for video games and a strong interest in exploring the world of software development. I have experience in creating mods for the popular game Minecraft, allowing players to customize and enhance their gameplay experience.  

🌱 I'm currently learning new programming concepts to expand my skill set, and one area I'm particularly interested in is C++ and reverse engineering. I find the process of understanding how software works and unlocking its secrets fascinating. Through this, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of game development and contribute to the field in the future.
